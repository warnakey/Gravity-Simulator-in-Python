Gravity Simulator
-----------------

A gravity simulator in python

Version 1.0 released August 1, 2018 at 2:30am
+ Initial commit
+ Allows you to enter a number of objects (between 1 and 5), enter their mass, then enter their x, y and z coordinates in space
+ After giving all inputs the program outputs the data in a list
+ Several bugs currently exist that need to be fixed, such as all coordinates data for all objects being stored into 1 list (super confusing)
+ Several optimizations need to be made including removing duplicate code, removing excess comments and completing a few concepts
+ In the future we will have a GUI and a visual representation of the objects interacting with each other as if they were planets in space
+ Future possibilities include the collision detection, the ability for objects that touch to combine and gain mass or a game functionality
